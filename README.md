# MorningStar

This is an outdated, somewhat broken build of a project I did while interning for a startup called Dazzlar.  The company has 
has since folded, so this is project is not under active development.  I am including it on my portfolio with full permission 
from the rights holders.

MorningStar is an intelligent keyboard app for Android.  It adapts to the user's hand size and placement to allow a user to type 
without looking at the screen.
